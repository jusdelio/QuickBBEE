This directory contains the "QuickBBEE" package.

- [bbee.py](bbee.py) includes two classes: `set_dparams`, which initializes an object to generate two spectra EE and BB using provided models, and `set_cparams`, which initializes an object allowing the user to specify their own model created only by [cosmopower](https://github.com/alessiospuriomancini/cosmopower/blob/main/cosmopower).
